                    <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                        Hey! I'm Tom, mostly known as Nyuma. I'm a student at Oregon State University studying Computer Science and
                        aspiring to become a software engineer. In my free time, I enjoy building web-based hobby projects, exploring nature, and writing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As someone who's lived with sickle cell disease for over 20 years, I've experienced first-hand the challenges that come with managing the condition.
                        From frequent hospital visits to managing pain crises, I know how difficult it can be to stay on top of your health and prevent these complications.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My favorite contributions in this field are to socially good projects that help others. I've always been extremely passionate about building products that make a difference in people's lives; more recently, those leveraging A.I.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I created SickleSense to help people just like me better understand their health and improve their quality of life. There's many things in this application
                        that I wish I had growing up with sickle cell disease, and I'm excited to share it with the world so that <strong>no one has to go through this alone.</strong>
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        A friend of mine informed me about the Afrotech AI Hackathon <span className="line-through">2 weeks into the competition</span>,
                        and I decided to participate in it to build Sickle Sense. Regardless of the outcome,
                        I'm excited to see how this project grows and the impact it has on the sickle cell community. So truly, from me to you, thanks for checking it out!
